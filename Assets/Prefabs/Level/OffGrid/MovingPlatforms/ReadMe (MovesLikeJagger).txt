As in it moves jankey as hell.

Okay, so this object has a trigger on top of it by default that activates its movement.
Feel free to unparent that trigger, or move it somewhere else.
If you want you could even use a multitrigger for this.

Also, that blue star thingy is the location that the platform moves to. It's just like in Unreal Tournament! I actually had fun implementing that part of this...
