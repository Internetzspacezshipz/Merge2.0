This triggerbox uses an event system to control what functions activate in a target object... Complicated, I know. You probably just want to ask Cole to help you with it since he's some sort of god of shitty programming.

Cannot Retrigger makes it so after you trigger it the first time it cannot be activated again.

Triggers on boxes makes it trigger on boxes.

I don't think I need to tell you these things, the names are pretty obvious.
